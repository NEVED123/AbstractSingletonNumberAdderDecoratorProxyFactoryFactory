# AbstractSingletonNumberAdderDecoratorProxyFactoryFactory

You can feel the immense cleverness and ingenuity in this code. There is something so... "robust" about it. This code will last through the eons with its flexible design and considering for future requirements. You feel inferior because you can't write code as brilliant as this, you feel stupid for not reading [*Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) cover to cover. This code features what we like to call "vertical complexity". The more lines, the more complex, the better. The person who wrote this code in production will get a raise because management only looks at line count. 

Developers fear him...
